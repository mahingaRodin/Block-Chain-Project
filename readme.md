# Python Blockchain Implementation

This project is a simple Python-based blockchain to demonstrate the core concepts of blockchain technology, including:
- Block creation
- Hashing
- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Chain validation

It provides a basic understanding of how blockchains work in a straightforward and educational way.

## Features
1. **Genesis Block**: The first block in the chain, with no previous hash.
2. **Block Structure**: Includes index, timestamp, data, previous hash, nonce, and hash.
3. **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Ensures that blocks meet a predefined difficulty level before being added to the chain.
4. **Chain Validation**: Verifies the integrity and correctness of the blockchain.
